# JARM (Junior Aerial Routing Method) / VIC1

## Project Overview

**JARM** (Junior Aerial Routing Method) is a Return To Launch Site (RTLS) rocket initiative focused on developing a reusable rocket system capable of autonomously returning to its launch location. The project utilizes the **VIC** (Vehicle in-Flight Controller) board, based on the STM32F411RET6 microcontroller, for real-time flight control, telemetry, and navigation. The VIC board interfaces with both IMU and GPS sensors to provide precise attitude and position data. JARM integrates hardware, embedded software, and advanced control algorithms to achieve reliable, safe, and repeatable rocket recovery.

## Features

- Autonomous flight and RTLS navigation using the VIC board (STM32F411RET6)
- Real-time telemetry, data logging, and diagnostics
- Access to IMU and GPS information for accurate flight control
- Reusable airframe and propulsion system
- Modular architecture for rapid prototyping and upgrades

## Future Updates

- Integration of advanced guidance and control algorithms
- Enhanced telemetry and ground station communication
- Improved landing precision and system robustness
- Expanded documentation, tutorials, and user guides

## Expectations

- Achieve successful RTLS flights and recoveries
- Gather and analyze flight data for iterative improvements
- Encourage collaboration and learning in rocketry, embedded systems, and autonomous vehicles
